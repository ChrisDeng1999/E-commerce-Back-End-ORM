## Description

This is my E-commerce Back End ORM project. This project is mainly used to test routes and to see if a user hits a specific route what data will the user then get. I was unable to get the functionality for parts of the Product routes so that is something I will be working towards.


## Installation

Once you have installed the application, you will have to make sure you have every dependency installed and then you can type npm start in your terminal and use Insomnia to test the application out!

Below is a link to a quick video that goes over what the application can do!
